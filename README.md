# S-Koo-L
This is a revolutionary (or maybe evolutionary) school management system with an interface similar to that of SQL.

See the document in the [Documentation Stuff](/Documentation%20Stuff) directory to read about the project. This README will be updated soon.

This was [my high school](http://www.adityabirlaschools.com/KESROL/aboutus.html) project so it currently displays my former
school's name. A lot of things (like school time, session length and school name) are hard-coded that shouldn't have been.
Change the `start_t` (start time) on line 834 in [S-Koo-L.py](/S-Koo-L.py) to change the school start-time to any recent hour if you want to see the code running.

There's a lot of room for improvement, so contributions are welcome!
