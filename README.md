# S-Koo-L
This is a revolutionary (or maybe evolutionary) school management system with an interface similar to that of SQL.

See the document in the [Documentation Stuff](https://github.com/schedutron/S-Koo-L/tree/master/Documentation%20Stuff) directory to read about the project. This README will be updated soon.

This was [my high school](http://www.adityabirlaschools.com/KESROL/aboutus.html) project so it currently displays my former
school's name. A lot of things (like school time, session length and school name) are hard-coded that shouldn't have been.
There's a lot of room for improvement, so contributions are welcome!
